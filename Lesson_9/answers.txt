1. The preventDefault method is used in event handlers to prevent the default action that belongs to the event from occurring.

2. A jQuery plugin is a reusable piece of code that extends the functionality of the jQuery library. 
It allows developers to encapsulate a specific set of methods or functionalities, making it easy to apply the same functionality to multiple elements across a project. 
By creating a plugin, you can avoid code duplication and maintain a cleaner, more modular codebase.

The jQuery plugin being used in this code is defined at the bottom of the script and is responsible for converting form data to a JavaScript object and vice versa. 
The plugin extends jQuery's functionality by adding two custom methods: toObject and fromObject.

3. Explain what each jQuery function call is doing.
$(document).ready(function () {...});: This ensures that the enclosed code runs only after the entire document is fully loaded. It waits until the DOM is ready before executing the function.
$('[required="required"]'): Selects all elements with the attribute required="required".
.prev("label"): Selects the previous sibling element with the tag label for each selected element.
.append("<span>*</span>"): Appends a <span>*</span> to each of the selected labels.
.children("span"): Selects the newly appended <span> elements.
.addClass("required"): Adds the required class to these <span> elements.
$("tbody tr:even"): Selects all even rows (tr elements) within tbody elements.
.addClass("even"): Adds the even class to these rows.
$("#taskCreation").removeClass("not");: Removes the not class from the element with the ID taskCreation, likely making it visible or active.
.closest("td"): Finds the closest parent td element.
.siblings().andSelf(): Selects all sibling elements of the td as well as the td itself.
.toggleClass("rowHighlight");: Toggles the rowHighlight class on these elements.
$(evt.target).closest("tr").remove();: Removes the closest tr (table row) element to the clicked target.
updateTaskCount();: Calls the function updateTaskCount to update the displayed number of tasks.
$("#taskForm").fromObject(task);: Populates the form #taskForm with the task object data using the custom fromObject method.
$("#taskCreation").removeClass("not");: Removes the not class from the #taskCreation element.
